I created this 3D text using Three.js and following Bruno Simon's [Three JS Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course. Three.js already supports 3D text geometries with the TextGeometry class. I used a particular json format called typeface. 

I made it in honor of my favorite donuts shop: [Voodoo Doughnut](https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/).
